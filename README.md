# Leaflet.Draw.Advanced

## Features
* Allowing "lazy mode" for `L.Polyline` editing. In this mode, only nodes near the cursor are drawn.
* Extending `L.Polyline` to `L.Route`, allowing to handle routes
* `L.Route` can be inverted, and can take a `router`, that means a routing mechanism.
* `L.Draw.Routing.Router` classes allows the use of routing mechanisms.
* `L.Draw.routing.Router.OSM` to handle routing with OSM web-services.
